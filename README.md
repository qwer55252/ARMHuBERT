## Installation
Install virtual environment & the necessary packages with: 
```
cd tools
bash install_virtualenv.sh
```

## Distillation
1. Download the teacher model checkpoint to perform knowledge distillation, and place it under the root path, `./`.

	+ For HuBERT Base: [link](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/hubert) (`hubert_base_ls960.pt`)
	+ For wavLM Base: [link](https://huggingface.co/s3prl/converted_ckpts/tree/main) (`wavlm_base.pt`)

2. Download the [LibriSpeech](https://www.openslr.org/12) dataset.

	+ For 100h distillation, download `train-clean-100`
	+ For 960h distillation, download whole dataset, `train-clean-100`, `train-clean-360`, `train-other-500`
	+ For validation, download `dev-clean`
		+ You can validate your model with test clean other either. In this case, please download `test-clean`, and modify `self.eval_data` in `train.py` file.

3. Modify the configuration file in `./conf/[model_name]/[config].yaml`.    
	+ For example, the configuration file `./conf/armhubert/armhubert-960.yaml` contains all the settings for reproducing ARMHuBERT on LibriSpeech 960h dataset.	
	+ Set the path to the teacher model checkpoint at `teacher_model`, and the root path to the LibriSpeech dataset at `libri_root`. 

4. Then, run the following command:
```
python train.py -c ./conf/[model_name]/[config].yaml
```

For ARMHuBERT,
	```
	python train.py -c ./conf/armhubert/armhubert-960.yaml
	```

After training, the model checkpoints and the corresponding configuration file will be created at `./results/pretrain/`.


## Fine-tuning
0. If you don't feel like training your model, feel free to use our [checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/sungnyun/ARMHuBERT/tree/main).
   
2. Clone and install the [S3PRL toolkit](https://github.com/s3prl/s3prl) with ```pip install -e ".[all]"``` (dev mode).

3. Copy the entire `./models/[model_name]` folder into `<s3prl root>/s3prl/upstream/`.

4. Please add upstream importing line in `<s3prl root>/s3prl/hub.py`.
	
	```
	from s3prl.upstream.[model_name].hubconf import *
	```
	For ARMHuBERT,
	```
	from s3prl.upstream.armhubert.hubconf import *
	```

5. Please change each config file of s3prl downstream tasks as follows.
	+ Uncomment learning rate scheduler
	+ Learning rate scaled to 10x in spekaer identification (SID) task

6. Run the following command to fine-tune the ARMHuBERT model.

	For automatic speech recognition (ASR) as an example:
	```
	python run_downstream.py \
	-m train \
	-n ARMHuBERT-ASR \  # You can set your exp name whatever you want
	-u armhubert \
	-d asr \
	-k <path to .ckpt file in <git root>/results/pretrain/> \
	-g <path to .yaml file in <git root>/results/pretrain/>
	```
	Note: Refer to the [SUPERB docs](https://github.com/s3prl/s3prl/blob/master/s3prl/downstream/docs/superb.md) for more information on usage details and data preparation.

## Result

<p align="center">
<img width="1400" alt="result" src="./assets/result.png">
</p>

We evaluate our student models on the SUPERB benchmark.

MaskHuBERT highly improves the performances in content- and semantics-related tasks. See PR, ASR, SF, and IC.

ARMHuBERT shows promising improvements when compared to MaskHuBERT in SF and SID tasks, exhibiting a similar level of performance in other tasks.

ARMHuBERT achieves a better overall score of **78.1** with less parameters than MaskHuBERT.
This is an state-of-the-art performance for an end-to-end distillation approach such as [Deep-versus-wide 12-L](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06867?context=eess.AS) or [FitHuBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00555).

You can also check that our model works on other Transformer backbone model, [wavLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13900), too.

## Try this distillation strategy with your Transformer backbone models
We have only performed evaluation on HuBERT-based models, but this strategy can be performed identically on any speech model with a Transformer backbone. E.g. [AST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01778) (Audio Spectrogram Transformer).

- **<U>S</U>peech <U>T</U>empor<U>a</U>l <U>R</U>elation (STaR)**: Distill the knowledge by focusing on the pairwise **temporal relation** between two speech frames.
- **Temporal Gram Matrix (TGM)**: Propose Temporal Gram Matrix which aggregates channel information at two time steps.
  - Layer-wise TGM: Distill the TGM for every Transformer layer
  - Intra-layer TGM: Modify the TGM as computing the temporal relation between the input and output of a single Transformer layer.
- Incorporating two TGMs as the distillation objectives together, our student model STaRHuBERT (22M & 26M) shows the SOTA performance on the SUPERB benchmark with the metric of overall and generalizability scores.
- For further compression (9.39M & 14.1M), our approach shows the robust performance against degradation compares to other works.

## Distillation
We do not offer an official implementation code for distillation. 
Nevertheless, since STaRHuBERT is developed upon the backbone of ARMHuBERT, you can easily re-implement our apporach with this ARMHuBERT repository.


## Fine-tuning
You can reproduce our model with given checkpoints. Please follow the steps. (This is almost the same as ARMHuBERT case.)
   
1. Clone and install the [S3PRL toolkit](https://github.com/s3prl/s3prl) with ```pip install -e ".[all]"``` (dev mode).

2. Copy the entire `./models/starhubert` folder into `<s3prl root>/s3prl/upstream/`.

3. Please add upstream importing line in `<s3prl root>/s3prl/hub.py`.	
	```
	from s3prl.upstream.starhubert.hubconf import *
	```

4. Please change each config file of s3prl downstream tasks as follows.
	+ Uncomment learning rate scheduler
	+ Learning rate scaled to 10x in spekaer identification (SID) task

5. Run the following command to fine-tune the ARMHuBERT model.

	For automatic speech recognition (ASR) as an example:
	```
	python run_downstream.py \
	-m train \
	-n STaRHuBERT-ASR \  # You can set your exp name whatever you want
	-u starhubert \
	-d asr \
	-k <path to .ckpt file in <git root>/results/pretrain/> \
	-g <path to .yaml file in <git root>/results/pretrain/>
	```
	Note: Refer to the [SUPERB docs](https://github.com/s3prl/s3prl/blob/master/s3prl/downstream/docs/superb.md) for more information on usage details and data preparation.
